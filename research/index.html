<h1> HIV restriction factors (RFs) </h1>

<p class="lead">RFs are the cellular proteins intrinsically expressed in the host cells, and involved in the innate immune response to HIV infection that target specific stages in the viral life cycle. Structural and functional investigations of RFs and their viral targets provide great opportunities for the development of new antiviral therapies. </p>
<p class="lead">Specifically, TRIM5α potently inhibits HIV and other retroviruses by recognizing and stimulating premature disassembly of retrovirus capsid (CA) and activating downstream immune signaling. It is the molecular reason why HIV-1 cannot efficiently infect Old World monkeys. Since its discovery in 2004, obtaining structural information of TRIM5α has been a great challenge in the field due to its poor behavior for crystallization. We are aiming to reveal the mechanisms by which TRIM5α achieves the species-specific but shape-independent recognition of retrovirus capsids.

<p class="lead">SAMHD1 blocks HIV-1 infection in non-dividing human blood cells. The restriction requires its function as a dNTP phosphohydrolases (dNTPase) to deplete the cellular dNTP pool required for viral DNA synthesis. In dividing cells, SAMHD1 is phosphorylated at Thr-592, which negatively regulates its anti-HIV-1 activity. SAMHD1 also play an important role in the regulation of cellular dNTP levels, and are critical to the stability of the genome, DNA damage signaling and proper activation of the innate immune response. We are aiming to pursue a full understanding for the viral restriction of SAMHD1, which is still highly debatable.

<h1>Structural studies of Zika virus non-structural proteins</h1>

<p class="lead">An unprecedented epidemic of Zika virus infection broke out, which poses a significant public health threat at the international level. Neonatal microcephaly associated with Zika virus infection has already caused a public health emergency of international concern. The non-structural proteins of Zika virus, such as its helicase and NS3 protease, which play pivotal roles in viral replication, serve as attractive targets for therapy. We are aiming to unravel the structures and novel molecular mechanisms of activation and inhibition of ZIKV non-structural proteins, which helps identify new hot spots for rational drug design against flaviviruses.</p>
